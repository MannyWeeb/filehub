# FileHub

A modular web-application for [willburr](https://github.com/MannyWeeb/willburr) which extends it's functionalities to support sharing media, documents and any other files through a local network.

If you're looking to share static content(saved website, or a folder without filehub UI) instead, have a look at [willburr-web](https://github.com/MannyWeeb/willburr-web), admittedly, it's a bit stale at the moment so It's not in great shape.

## Recent additions

* As a host, a simple dashboard window is provided which, for now, simply let's you know which network interfaces are being used(instead of using ipconfig).

* Simple guide on how to host, and how to connect to a server(for those who aren't tech-savvy).

* Improved Mobile UX(especially with File views).

* Information About the project, It's targeted audience and why I built it. (p.s: it's originally for teachers and school bodies).

* Deeply-linked routes(useful when accessing deeply nested files or folders).

## Future Updates may include

* Downloading folders and it's contents(Like what you see on MEGA).

* Support for natively viewing archives within the browser.

* Lazy loading(useful when shared directories are massive in depth and size).

* File Uploads(not really difficult to implement but users may spam the server with non-family friendly content, later tater).

* Translate to other dialects(Tagalog, Waray, Cebuano, etc).

* URL Shortening? (for obvious reasons).

* Considering to turn this as a standalone program(with server and web-app packed into one).
