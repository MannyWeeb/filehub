# FileHub

A modular web-application for [willburr](https://github.com/MannyWeeb/willburr) which extends it's functionalities to support sharing media, documents and any other files through a local network.

It also contains built-in support for viewing media files and documents.

*While the application is already working, it may require some documentations and guides on how to set it up and use it, I'm still thinking about how to present those effectively.*

## Future Updates may include

* Downloading folders and it's contents (Like what you see on MEGA)
* Support for natively viewing archives within the browser.
* A simple how to guide.
